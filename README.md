# Abstract Time Piece

This would be a project that would create an abstract time 'painting' based on the current location of the International Space Station.

## Summary

This would be purely experimental, and I have no idea what I would like it to look like yet, but I know I would like it to involve a lot of math in how it the visuals are actually generated. The user will not be able to actually interact with the piece since it will all depend on coordinates. Ideally, I would not leave anything to randomness, and no piece of it would be arbitrary.

## Component Parts

p5.js
"Where the ISS at" open API

## Challenges

Most likely figuring out how I want it to look like, and figuring out how I would like the math to work.

## Timeline


- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Code
- Week 3: Code
- Week 4: Code
- Week 5: Present!

## References and link

Soon to come - I will be looking at a lot of abstract paintings to help me out.
